## About

This website was reveloped for Paul John Group to show the excellent work, each company in the group does in various different sectors in the Construction Industry. 

The original site was created using a drag and drop web site developement tool online. This meant it wasn't responsive on mobiles, tablets and different media.

My mission was to re-design the site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to increase the companies presence online and give a more professional look when viewing on all devices.
