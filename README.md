## About

This website was reveloped for Paul John Group to show the excellent work, each company in the group does in various different sectors in the Construction Industry. 

The original site was created using a drag and drop web site developement tool online. This meant it wasn't responsive on mobiles, tablets and different media.

My mission was to re-design the site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to increase the companies presence online and give a more professional look when viewing on all devices.

### Styling

The website needed to be clear and concise and easy to view. The company logo for Paul John uses shades of red, yellow, grey, white and black. Colours from the logo were used but Yellow and Red were ignored due to the brightness of the colours.

I used the the below colours for the body, site sections, headers and footers, navigation and social media links.
