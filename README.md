## About

This website was reveloped for Paul John Group to show the excellent work, each company in the group does in various different sectors in the Construction Industry. 

The original site was created using a drag and drop web site developement tool online. This meant it wasn't responsive on mobiles, tablets and different media.

My mission was to re-design the site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to increase the companies presence online and give a more professional look when viewing on all devices.

## UX

The Goals of the website is to:-
1. Attract new clients to use Paul John Group for all there construction needs by showing current work on the website via Video, Pictures and Case Studies.

3. To work on all devices from PC's and Laptops to Tablets and Mobile phones.

### Styling

The website needed to be clear and concise and easy to view. The company logo for Paul John uses shades of red, yellow, grey, white and black. Colours from the logo were used but Yellow and Red were ignored due to the brightness of the colours.

I used the the below colours for the body, site sections, headers and footers, navigation and social media links.


![ColourScheme](Documentation/Images/ColourScheme.png)

The fonts chose were also based on the font used in the company logo, a nice rounded, easy to read font was used. the selections from google fonts were:-

- Muli with Sans-Serif as a backup.

### Responsive Testing

To check how the website runned on different devices I used Am-I-Responsive and Inspect in Google Chrome Developer Tools. While doing these tests I did the following:-

|  Test | Result  |  Extra Coding Required |
|---|---|---|
|  Logo displays correctly on all devices |  Tested using Google Crome Developer Tools - Logo was too big on Mobile Device |  Added a media query to correct the issue |
| H1,H2 and H3s testing on home page  | They looked too close to the edge of the screen on all devices  |  More Padding added to the container and each header |
|  Text display on home page on all devices |  Under the group of companies, it over lapped |  Used a media query to correct the text size on smaller devices |

All pages were tested vigorously using google chrome developer tools. On each page I tested:-
  - Images
  - Navbar Links
  - Text
  - Headings
  - Containers
  - Footer Links

Testing was also done on my PC at work, Laptop at home, Macbook at home, ipad at home and iphone at home. This allowed to see how the website looks physically on the actual device rather than on a screen.

### Additional Testing

Additonal testing was also done on Firefox, Edge as well as Chrome. 

Other members of my household also tested my website on different devices so this gave me an alternate viewpoint.

Testing was also carried out after my post by users in the slack community. The following issues were found which will be fixed prior to the next release.
 - Content under What we do section on the home page wasn't completed setences, suggestion to have it has a underordered list instead
 - Welcome to Paul John Group on the H5 header needs some padding adding on desktop devices
 - On the case studies page, the bold writing needs to be made more prominent
 - Punctuation on the News Page needs to be corrected.
 - Contact Us Page needs some padding adding on smaller devices, it was too close to the edge of the mobile screen.
 - New Website Post on the news page needs the play button removing because it looks like a video and might confuse users to try and click it.
 - No Favicon.ico
 - Reason on the select form isn't required when submitting a contact form.

 ### Code Validation

 W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service was used for validating the code, the following errors were corrected from the validation services

 - Some Images had illegal names with spaces or illegal characters in, the relevant images were changed.
 - The Iframe for google maps failed because the styling was included direct in the HTML which was copied from Google Maps website. All styling  was removed from HTML and added to CSS to correct the issue.
 - Two lines in each header for each page were pointing to two different CSS Files. Multiple lines removed to correct the issue.

 Now all pages on the website are now validated.
